### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version |
| :--- | ------- |
| **Node JS** | 12.13.0 (LTS) |
| **rabbitmq_server** | 3.8.2 |

### Types

1. One to One (Direct)

    > For one to one messaging, a producer sends messages to specified queue. A consumer receives messages from that queue.To ensure message is not lost, message acknowledgments can be sent back to producer to confirm a particular message has been received

    > File path - "./rbmq_basic/rbmq.producer and ./rbmq_basic/rbmq.consumer"

    > [Ref: One to One (direct)](https://robomq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/one-one/)

2. Routing - Filter Based (Topic)

    > For filter based routing, a producer declares the topic exchange when publishing a message. Messages sent with a particular routing key will be delivered to all the queues that are bound with a matching binding key. Filter based routing provides a method to use filter policies on routing key for choosing the recipients of messages.

    > <span>&ast;</span> (star) can substitute for exactly one word.
    > Example: 'topic.*' can be : topic1, topic2, topic3 etc.

    > <span>#</span> (hash) can substitute for zero or more words.
    > Example: "#.topic" can be: topic, Ftopic, Secondtopic, 123topic etc.

    > File path - "./topic"
